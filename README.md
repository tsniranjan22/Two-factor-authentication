# Two-factor-authentication
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts. It requires two forms of identification before you can gain access to an account or system: something you know (e.g., password) and something you have (e.g., phone, authenticator app).
